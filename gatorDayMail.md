Dear members of the Allegheny College community,


Next week, on Wednesday 22 September, there are no classes and the community is invited to come together to enjoy the program of activities we have planned for the Fall 2021 Gator Day.


Gator Day is offered every fall semester and features programs and workshops that highlight educational opportunities at Allegheny, that prepare students for life after graduation, and that help to create a greater sense of campus community. 


There are two programs for all students on Fall 2021 Gator Day Eve, Tuesday 21 September -- a paint & sip event at Grounds for Change (GFC) sponsored by GAP and community programming in residence halls.


Gator Day 2021 Schedule


For Fall 2021, we have featured sessions that emphasize our commitment to Inclusive Excellence. The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion defines "inclusion" as:


The active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity—in the curriculum, in the co-curriculum, and in communities (intellectual, social, cultural, geographical) with which individuals might connect—in ways that increase awareness, content knowledge, cognitive sophistication, and empathic understanding of the complex ways individuals interact within systems and institutions.


Fall 2021 Gator Day will be headlined by a report out from the LACRELA e-convenings for faculty and staff (Session 1), an Inclusive Mindset Workshop with Inclusion Design Group (IDG) for continuing students (offered twice, in Session 2 and Session 5), a program for first-year students called “Do All First-year Students Think The Same?” (offered twice, in Session 2 and Session 5), and an event for BIPOC student athletes (Session 4). Students interested in the Inclusive Mindset Workshop or “Do All First-year Students Think The Same?” will need to sign up as spaces are limited. Details are in the links above.


Concurrent student programs will be offered in Session 2, Session 3, and Session 5 from a variety of academic programs. Please take a look at the schedule and drop in wherever you think you’d be interested to learn more!


Fall Gator Day is a great way to meet new people, learn new things, and take advantage of many of the great opportunities that a residential liberal arts college like Allegheny has to offer. Enjoy!!


Best wishes for a safe and productive Gator Day!
